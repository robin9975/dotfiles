You're working on a linear issue, check which one by checking the branch name. Generally, the current chat context is enough information for you to continue. But.. if necessary, you can get more context about the issue and implementation plan from linear. 

Look for the task list: tasks-{issuenr}.md. 
Continue with the next task on hand. 

After a subphase is complete: 
- Validate that any TODO's added to the code are on the current tasks list, so we won't forget them
- Check whether it is neccearry to implement tests for the current functionality. If that isn't sufficient, add this to the tasks list for late. 
- Mark it as complete in the tasks file, then commit.
